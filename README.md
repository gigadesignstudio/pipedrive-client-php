## API versions

This SDK supports two API versions, each with its own namespace and documentation. Please refer to the version-specific README files for detailed documentation and examples:

- **[API v2 Documentation](docs/versions/v2/README.md)**: Includes usage examples and endpoint documentation for API version 2.
